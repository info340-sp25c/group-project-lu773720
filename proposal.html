            <h2>Problem Description</h2>
            <p><strong><em>Music is an essential form of self-expression, artistry, and entertainment for many. </em></strong></p>
            <p>Users discover new music through friends, social media (i.e. TikTok audios), exploring similar artists, or streaming services. With the popularisation of streaming, over 700 million people worldwide use apps like Spotify or Apple Music. These apps have evolved to do more than stream music. They create individualized music lists, allow users to collaborate or co-create playlists, recommend new music, and more. Unfortunately, these features are not always helpful: the streaming services don’t always accurately analyze a user’s taste, and users often face rigid functionality around these newer features. For example, users on Spotify can search for music based on their mood, but can’t filter further based on genre within the mood.  </p>

            <h3>App Description</h3>
            <p>Our website will cater to anybody with an appreciation for music, anyone who wishes they had better music recommendations, or anyone who has ever spent hours looking for the right music/playlist to fit their current mood and needs to no avail.  We aim to fulfil this unmet need through a sophisticated music recommendation system, allowing users to find that one song that they never knew they needed.  

                Inside this web application, we will have various features intended to meet these ends.  These features are as follows:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>[Half Feature] Allow the user to create a profile that will store things such as their general music preferences.</li>
                    <li>Based on the presets the user entered into the previously afformentioned profile, we will generally recommend new music to them, based off the inputted information.  Users would be able to 'favorite' any song they like, saving it to make sure they can go back to it later.</li>
                    <li>Music recommender based off of the user's current mood.  We will feed users songs based on a specific mood that they input into our system.  For a simple example, let’s say a user types out that they're currently feeling “Happy,”  Perhaps the system then gives them the song, <cite><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbZSe6N_BXs">Happy</a></cite> by Pharrell Williams, and starts to play it in their browser.  It will then keep giving them similar songs to fit the mood after that song ends.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>In order to play these songs, we plan on using the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/iTuneSearchAPI/index.html">iTunes Search API</a> in order to fetch data on specific songs.  For specific information and data on the songs, we could use the <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Database">MusicBrainz Song Database</a> to fetch this information.</p>

                <p>In using this app, users will be able to get higher quality general music recommendations, and also be able to find the exact type of music they need to fit a specific mood.  The days of fumbling around trying to find that one song they need will be over, and people can grow in connection with their music, as they put their newfound extra time to better use.</p>
